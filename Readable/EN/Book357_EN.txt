The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina

Glorious court life was my youth, and my old age a moonlit haze.
I had not wished to behave so treacherously, but my very life was threatened.
So I sought out my old work, and hid it in my clothes.
I do not understand the reason behind all that has happened, only that the mysterious person's motives must be perverse.
This poem was dedicated to Akahito, who to my great sorrow was banished.
