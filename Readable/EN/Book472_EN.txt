Despite repeated prohibitions, research on the Court of Desolation in the past decade has increased without ceasing.
Researchers who study the history of the Court of Desolation mainly go through three stages: Discovery, Investigation, and Fanaticism.
The earliest stage of research is the relatively basic "Discovery" phase, which causes little to no harm. The results of their discoveries will show that treasures related to life and death may be hidden within the Court of Desolation. This is also where the rumor of "bringing the dead back to life" may begin.
Following the initial phase is a prolonged "Investigation" phase. All documentation regarding the location of the Court of Desolation has been vague at best. As a result, the structure itself has never been truly discovered.
Many researchers deplete their resources searching in the desert, only to find a scant few remaining stone tablets with the words "Entering the Court of Desolation comes at the price of one's life."
Two different interpretations of the line have quickly emerged as a result. Some believe that "the price of one's life" is the key to entering the Court of Desolation, while others asserted that it was a requirement for the Court to appear. Because the Court of Desolation has never been discovered, the latter view gradually became mainstream.
As a result, many researchers went in a short period of time. Overtaken by their fervent desire to make the Court of Desolation appear, they attempted to sacrifice their lives. Relevant research became increasingly dangerous and was eventually banned.
But even after that, many Akademiya scholars secretly continued their research. It was not until seven scholars — including Murtada Radkani — were arrested that research into the Court of Desolation entered a period of stagnation once again...
