The little hero slipped out of doors by night, and with his friend rushed headlong into the wolves' forest.
With his slingshot he chased boars, and with sturdy branches he would battle imaginary monsters.
Following the shining Seelie deep into the woods, he discovered a treasure that had laid buried for a thousand years.

That treasure was a small yellow flower.

When the tired hero returned to his childhood bedroom, and flipped through the proof of his first adventures,
He discovered to his surprise that the long-hidden flower had yet to wilt.
Yet in this it was alone, for everything else had changed with the passing of years.
