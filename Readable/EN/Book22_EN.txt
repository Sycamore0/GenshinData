The playful Barbatos had not reached those lands, so they remained covered by ice and snow.
Every creature who ventured there risked freezing their paws and hooves off.
"It's cold, too cold! It's freezing! My claws are going to shatter!"

"Oink, oink, oink! My frozen snout is turning purple!"
There lived but a single lone wolf pup in that place.
