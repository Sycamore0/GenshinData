
They say that,
The line of chief priests have always seen this same sight as their days draw to an end:
A mountain of crowns in a secret place, beneath a withered tree—
—each one hiding a lifetime of secrets kept.
Each retiring chief priest offers up their crown of flawless white branches to this world.
Every mighty and ancient city, and every austere place of sacrifice must one day return to profundity in the earth.

All prosperity must someday end.
But this does not mean that nothing is eternal.

At the end of a cycle, the earth shall be renewed. Thus eternity is cyclical.
The search for truth is a product of prosperity, and not the seed that plants it.

They say that,
Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly.
The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice.
