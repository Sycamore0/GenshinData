Praise be to the Great and Excellent Ogosho, the Almighty Shogun, whose glorious lightning fills the skies. May Your eternal way spread to the furthest seas, and may Your mighty name resound like thunder in every corner of the realm.
Report submitted by Tenryou Commissioner Takayuki of the Kujou Clan:
The Vision Hunt Decree proceeds at great pace and without obstacle. By the grace and might of Your Excellency, the wayward have been quashed and the deserters have returned. All in the land bow to Your will with reverence and gratitude in their hearts.
Peace now endures throughout the land of Inazuma thanks to the divine power of Your Excellency.
