
Those were the years of the lord of the labyrinth...
It is said that the most virtuous and visionary of the royal servants was a young girl who could understand the language of all beasts and read the poetry of moonlight.
She guarded the silent forest, the still water that embraced the moon, and the endless hunting grounds at the very end of the dream forest.
"We were born in the verdant royal forest. Our world is under the tree-shade and above the meadow."
"That which comes from the forest must return to it. As long as we follow the laws of nature, then we shall not fear death."
"For all those who follow nature must pass through the maze of the forest and reach that endless plain."
Her teachings once inspired many children, but like the blood of tigers, it too would slowly grow thin...

Those were the years of the ominous moon...
They say that the blind boy followed in the footsteps of his white-armored brother, traversing kingdoms, mountains, and rivers,
At last becoming lost in the dark forest.
He was obsessed with swordsmanship but was gentler than anyone. He was too dogmatic, but adhered to justice more than anyone...
At the end of the everlasting, white phantom in his heart, what he discovered was a relic of the woods, pure white as the moonlight.
Later, there came beasts that lusted after flesh and blood. When the huntress finally came to him, following the shimmering light of the white branches,
He had already lost the power to make wishes, and the white form that once guided him had faded into darkness and disappeared...

Those were the years when the night was on the rise. Those were the years when dawn was still far-off.
From the nightmare, the wise caught a glimpse of the dark longsword and the red blooming in the water.
