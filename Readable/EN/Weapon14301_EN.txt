This version of the Magic Guide generated much controversy when published.
In addition to the defiance of basic common sense seen in Chapter VII: Principles of the Anemo Element,
errors can also be observed even concerning the basic principles of the Hydro and Electro elements.
Evidently, the book was not peer-reviewed before publishing.
Nevertheless, the book is still the most authoritative guide to magic in existence.
