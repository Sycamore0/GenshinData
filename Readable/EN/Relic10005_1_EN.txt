The bloodthirsty berserker ravaged the lands, fighting humans and monsters alike, and even challenged the gods.
In a barren and lifeless land, he encountered a giant monster.
His iron mask could not conceal his rage, and so an endless fight ensued.
Hours, days, and years passed. The monster was finally defeated.
The berserker sucked out the marrow of the monster's broken horn. This was how the victor drank to his success.
