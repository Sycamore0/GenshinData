This flower once bloomed in a foreign land, but its colors faded after it became encased in ice.
It was frozen when picked, serving as an eternal memento for the Knight of Boreas.

The Knight of Boreas had a heart of firm iron and a body hardened like the glaciers of the North.
Wolves befriended him and the North Wind accompanied him.

Yet few knew he belonged not to the heartless snowscape of the North.
His true home was filled with never-withering flowers and never-frozen rivers.
But he left his homeland. For he had a ranger's boundless spirit, which conflicted with the sages' narrow idealism.
The flower he picked became his loyal companion through countless winters.
