
A crown made of ice and silver,
oblivious to the spring of the North.

Along with the North Wind, the Knight of Boreas traveled through raging storms.
The Knight of Boreas fought with monsters on the icy plains of the North.

He traveled alone now, for the unrelenting blizzard had buried every last one of his companions in the snow.
The merciless wind itself had become his one faithful travel companion.
The hearts of those who look into the abyss shall be engulfed by the abyss,
and the souls of those who fall into the glaciers shall become trapped in the glaciers.
