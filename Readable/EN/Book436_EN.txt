O Nagarjuna,
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I bless this land of eternal calamity.
When the sludge of the deepest depths of the abyss stained the first kingdom,
The glorious spirits that aided the Lord of Wisdom dispersed a million ways.
I crossed back over the River of Sorrow in my thirst for spring water.
I opened a path for the benevolent spirits so that the merciful light of wisdom may illuminate the four corners.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by the light of numberless spirits, I nourish the benevolent spirits in the sea of flowers.
Behold, the spirits' light reveals the essence of the spirit, the final descendant of the god of grass and trees.
Behold, the warrior who remains after a hundred battles is the Devs' foe.
Not even the inky gloom from beyond the skies can erode their forms.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by the light of a million spirits, I have transcended the dead of this foul earth.
Cleanse the sinless of their sins, so that they may be reborn in a pure land free of suffering.
In the chakras of the earth are contained the karmic seeds that will give birth to all things.
The fleeting blights and glories of the earthly realm are naught but the illusion of existing seeds.

O Nagarjuna,
Aided by the light of countless spirits, I have cleansed the abyss of heaven above.
The sludge welling up from the depths of the abyss has finally receded,
The legacy of Dahri, too, has submitted to the law.
A thousand songs were sung in unison, and the heavy rains abated for a time.

O Nagarjuna,
If the dark tide reappears and the black abyss returns,
Sing this hymn and pray for that prevailing light of the spirits.
That eternal light of the spirits will guide us on our path upwards.
