The young hero's first battle ended, and for the first time he tasted the sweet wine of victory.
That day, deep of the vine he drank together with his closest friend — supportive, joyful, and blissfully ignorant.

Many years later, when the cataclysm came, he led the knights to fight for his homeland.
On the eve of battle, he advised his childhood friend and long-time deputy to come drink with him.

"If you do not return, I will not mourn you."
"Nay, I will toast you, and drink in your honor, just as we do today."
