
A glossy and shining feather of a falcon. It once served as a fine fletching on one of the Viridescent Venerer's arrows.

In the past, when the Viridescent Venerer's arrow hit its target,
she would come down and stroke the fur of her prey gently until its life force returned to nature in peace.
For she knew that one day, she too would embark on a journey to the place where the souls of her prey rested.

The Viridescent Venerer believed that at the end of her life, she would wake up from reality,
and be reunited with the departed at an endless hunting ground.

But she also believed that the moment her arrow pierced through the monster that had killed the boy,
that endless hunting ground at the end of her life was gone from her grasp.
For she killed that mutated monster not for the sake of survival,
but out of vengeance and suffering.
