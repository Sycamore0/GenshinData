Through plains and forests, the exile traveled alone in the wild.
Through thick layers of dark clouds, an azure feather fell on his shoulder.
The feather came from a panicked bird escaping from the falcon, just like the exile.
The feather represents the spirit of a nestless, free bird, just like the exile.
