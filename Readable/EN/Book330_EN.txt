Dear {NICKNAME} and Paimon,
I'm so sorry about the manner of my parting. Though I did apologize to you, deep down, I know that I'm in no position to do so, nor shall I be so shameless as to appear before you again.
I'm grateful for your offer to save me from my dilemma, but I had wondered about your approach. It wasn't until you took my uniform that I became aware that your plan would put you in harm's way.
Therefore, I left Yae Publishing House in search of you. I found you in Araumi, along with a young lady — Ms. Momoyo — whom I had only seen in Kamera pictures up till then.
I once took advantage of our resemblance to pose as her. She had every reason to hate my guts, but instead, she took such a huge risk to help fake my death, even at the price of one of her eyes.
An unworthy sinner as I am, I've nonetheless received way more kindness from you than I could ever repay.
I have put all my savings since I came to Inazuma in the bag beside this letter. Consider it a gift for you and Ms. Momoyo, as I know no other way to express my gratitude. Rest assured, I earned every coin through honest work.
Farewell, then. I shall leave Inazuma and never return. I owe this land too much.
