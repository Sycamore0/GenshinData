
A bronze compass used by a seaman.
In an ever-tumultuous life of wandering,
It points toward the direction where its owner's heart lies.

The rough Skipper once used this compass to guide his huge ship,
Navigating treacherous ocean paths and conquering huge whirlpools.
It also guided the one whose deep hatred hid behind an uninhibited laugh,
And who, lost and despondent, sought death and burning drink...

"I believe you all sing that the thief could not avoid the gallows in the end, eh?"
"As long as you have a place to belong to, even ending up in the belly of a fish would be alright—"
"Hey now, didn't you sign a contract with this ship when you came aboard?"
"That memory didn't get washed down with the wine, did it?"
"Good, then — after all, it is time to fulfill your contract."

"Is that so? ...Well, alright. It doesn't matter anymore, anyway..."
