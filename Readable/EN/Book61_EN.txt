—God of Wealth—
Liyue Harbor has been a haven for treasures from all corners of the world since ancient times. It is a place where merchants and the wealthy flourish. It is also where Mora, the coins accepted as currency throughout Teyvat, are minted. The word "Mora" is derived from "Morax," which is another name for the Lord of Rock. Many people therefore worship the Lord of Geo as the God of Wealth and Commerce.
Business people will burn incense and make offerings of fine food to the Lord of Geo in the hope of receiving his blessing. After all, he's the richest guy in the world! ...The richest god, I mean.
