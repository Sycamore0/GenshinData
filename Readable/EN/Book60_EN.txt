The intrepid adventurers of Liyue Harbor have another name for the Lord of Geo. They call him "The Groundbreaker."
The reason is that it was a combination of their forebears' spirit of breaking new ground and the Lord of Rock's steadfast protection that brought Liyue Harbor into being.
Adventurers from Liyue Harbor share their forebears' desire to forge ahead and break new ground, with determination as unshakable as the mountains.
