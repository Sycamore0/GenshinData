
Amid the constantly shifting tides of humanity, even the firmest laws and intransigent ideals will be ground down slowly,
And even the iron grip of logic, the essence of which is eternal and unchanging, can be shifted by human hearts.
Jades are the children of the earth, bearing the spirit of the veins whence they came, and the firmness of bedrock.
As such, a certain person would fashion them into tools, as prayers for the safety and peace of the people.

"These emerald-green jades are most pure of quality, and can reflect human hearts — or so it was meant to be."
"But humans are not pure and spotless, but rather are alive, beautiful, yet ever-changing."

Over the years, this person would hear the jades whisper of the fickle interests of mortals,
And would spend thousands of such years giving silent and slow thought to the joys and sorrows of humanity.

Even the long-lived and hard rock would be rendered smoothed-edged by nature,
And even the seemingly-eternal trio of moons would come to be parted in death...

Over numberless days, the jades that read mortal hearts said thus:
"These transient souls are small yet strong, ever-changing, ever seeking new things."
"Compared to stable stone, every human is full of infinite possibility and limitless potential."

And so, with eyes as if inquiring of one's own children, did he who walked among mortals with immortal jade experience their fleeting joys and cares.
The jade at his waist shone with a curious light, painting pictures of the transient human realm...

But for such ancient beneficence to perceive the hearts and minds of those who wear common flesh,
Shall surely take a thousand years more of wandering, and the baptism of mortal travail and change...
