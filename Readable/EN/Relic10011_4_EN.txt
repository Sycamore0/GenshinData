One who is favored by fortune tends to experience at least their fair share of miracles.
The legendary four-leaf clover, for instance, is a precious find that brings luck to its bearer.
Once, while playing in the field, the carefree young boy known as Lucky Dog happened across just such a clover.
Delighted, he plucked it from the ground and put it in his pocket.
No-one knows whether it was the clover which brought him his good fortune, or the other way around.
