
An adventurer once traveled through a forest in search of rare beasts never seen before.
As he tore his way recklessly through the foliage, the adventurer tripped on a tree root.
When he regained consciousness, he saw a girl so beautiful that he was willing to give up the adventurer's life to be with her.
Her appearance was surreal, with a cluster of feathers adorning her hair.
