The feather of a falcon proudly perched on top of an old noble's hat.
Hunting with the common folk and sharing the spoils with them was an old tradition.

Commonplace were the hunts, a hobby of the ruling class of Mondstadt.
The festivities were shared with their servants and the common folk,
As a sign of the benevolence of the nobles.
All the people were eager participants in the festivities.

Hunts soon lost their meaning.
The nobles took everything as their own, presuming it their right.
Proudly the feather still stood, yet faded was its color in the people's eyes.
