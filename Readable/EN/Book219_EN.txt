—Modest Fortune—
The air pressure is a little low, which makes you think back far into your past.
Memories of your long-lost youth and friends with whom you have lost contact come to mind.
They bring with them a touch of nostalgia, and a hint of sadness.
It is good to remember the past once in a while. May it help you calm your mind and face the future.

Your lucky object for the day: Fresh Mint
Wherever there is vegetation, there is Mint.
In this sense, Mint is the most resilient life-form in the world.
It is said that it even grows amid the snow of Mondstadt's highest mountain.
