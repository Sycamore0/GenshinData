
One of the countless raven feathers stuck to the Bloodstained Knight.
For where there is blood, ravens shall follow.

In the end the Bloodstained Knight could no longer tell
whether the blood that stained him was his own or that of his enemies.

Eventually, on his long journey filled with bloodshed, he came to a realization:
His path of so-called chivalry had turned him from the white knight he used to be into the monster he had now become.
His only followers were the ravens drawn to the bloodshed he left in his wake.
