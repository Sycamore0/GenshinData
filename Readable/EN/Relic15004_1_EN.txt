A ritual goblet forged of ice.
It holds not wine, but the hollering wind.

The howling wind of the North was like a ferocious wolf pursuing the knight along his path.
A normal traveler would have been devoured by the frosty wind.

But he was not a normal traveler.
In the storm, the knight raised the goblet filled with frosty wind and proposed a toast to his howling travel partner.
Together they drank, the bitter wind serving as their wine. The knight and the North Wind became friends.
