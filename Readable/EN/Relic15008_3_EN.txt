
A luxurious platinum mask that once belonged to a knight of noble birth.
The dark stains of dry blood are now a permanent part of its appearance.

As the Bloodstained Knight reached out to help a person in need after slaying the monster,
The way she cowered in fear made the knight realize:
He was now a monster himself.
Tainted by the blood and cruelty of his drawn-out war.

"Shield me from the eyes"
"Of those I vowed to protect."
"And shield them from the horrors I am bound to effect."
