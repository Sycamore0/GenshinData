A strangely-shaped kettle that plays a wondrous tune as the water flows out.
There was always music in the life of a Troupe member, even when drinking water.

An ancient tale tells of a wandering troupe that roamed the land.
For flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows. They performed not only for friends, but also for foes.
They traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing Mare Jivari.

The tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them.
"Along with the boundless tunes we walk."
"Wherever there is music, there is us."
