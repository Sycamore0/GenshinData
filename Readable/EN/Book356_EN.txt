The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou

Mine dwelling was far from the wider world, but for my fame my peace was disturbed.
In blue-clad I went before Tenshukaku to present our work, but Aoi's work was missing a page.
I knelt and begged for divine wrath to be stilled, and I told what I knew of how it was lost.
The previous night I had been drunk, and then a person's shadow had passed over me.
Some treacherous scoundrel must have stolen the poem, leading to my great loss of face.
