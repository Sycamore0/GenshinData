
It is said that this jade ornament comes from the long-sealed sacred mountain.
Just as a Starconch separated from the sea will recall the sound of the waves,
The ornament will also emit the sound of flowing water.

You may often hear such rumors in inns...
"You know, legend has it that the greatest treasure of the mountains is a slab of fine jade that can bring down sweet rains."
"But when the world was in turmoil, demons began to covet its power."
"So the master of the mountain split it into many parts, forming each part into different shapes, so as to hide them."
"Then, the master concealed them underwater, in the hills, and some were even offered to shrines."
"In the legends of Chenyu Vale, these jade ornaments bear the blessing of a deity's pact."
"It's just that no one has been able to find them, even after so many years..."

The priest had been ever careful in hiding this jade loop on their person.
But on certain years, they would discreetly show it to a friend with no sense of refinement on the eve of a departure.
The priest would speak of its patterns and its origins, and of the pact made with a deity by their ancestors,
But the friend was busy pounding herbs with mortar and pestle, and did not hear a single word.

"We do this song and dance every year, and I've heard this story who-knows-how-many times."
"Didn't you say you'd treat me to some tea when you get back? Let's talk then."
But that which came from the waters was not that which she had thought would come, and would vanish henceforth back into those waters...

Till today, the artisans of Yilong Port still make such simple ornaments.
Visiting merchants will also often place these jade loops close to their ears, as the legend says,
Wondering if they can truly hear the sound of the rain pitter-pattering on mountain stone.
