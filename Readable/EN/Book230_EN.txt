—Great Fortune—
Whenever you draw your blade, it shall lead you towards victory. The shine of your blade as it leaves its sheath will also inspire those around you.
Today, a single shot from your bow will shoot down an airborne prey, and a single strike against a guard will hit their weak spot.
If you have no target, try looking around. You might find a surprise waiting for you.
Also, don't forget to share your good luck with your less-fortunate companions.

Your lucky object for the day: Rare Horsetail
Horsetails grow in fields of Silvergrass, but are much taller.
It is a fitting symbol for you, who stands tall and proud in this world.
