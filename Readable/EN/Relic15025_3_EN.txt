
There is a time appointed for all things to live and die, and the cycle continues on forever,
Thus did the ruler of trees once preach the cycle of life.
All things that die will gain new life in some other form,
And all things that decay will sprout pure and tender new shoots.
Fruits that fall upon the land will feed the beasts of the land,
And the beasts will return to the land and themselves become fruits.
The forests were always full of life.

Legend has it that when the god of trees created a forest amidst the sands,
The first order of the day was to create a device that could call forth the rains.
Thus did the bright moon reflect the patterns of light from the labyrinth upon the water,
And from this was the "tiger" born.

The tiger's stripes were ever-changing, resembling the forest's branches,
And thus did it become the ruler of the jungle, whose name was Viaghara.
The blessed lord of the forest walked amidst the garden, head held high,
Ruling over the primates, the birds, and the beasts of the labyrinth.

Later, the seeds of the pomegranates fell upon the soil and gave birth to the forest spirits.
Thus did the lord of the forest bless them under the first Vasara Tree, and made a pact with the divine,
To share the labyrinth with them, and to command the birds and beasts not to harm them.

Though the sun's light was shrouded for a time, the flowing water was once corrupted,
And the final forest lord died in defense of the nurseries of life,
A large whiskered cat succeeded that regal name,
And guarded the woodland creatures in imitation of that lord.
Though it could not match even an iota of that lord's might,
It would keep the promise and protect the forest,
Nor would it ever attempt to harm the guardian spirits of the trees.
Yes, though the ever-changing labyrinth has perished,
The forest is still filled with life.
