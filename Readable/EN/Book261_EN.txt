—Jinren Island—
After stealing a small boat from the pirate ship, I rowed for three days before finally reaching shore.

From here, I can see the legendary Takayama on Narukami Island, along with the giant sakura tree that grows on it. The colors of the Sacred Sakura are gentle in the moonlight... It makes me think of home.

I wonder if Dongdong feels lonely in Qingce Village. I don't know if I made the right decision, coming all this way just to make a living. It's probably me just getting old, thinking about all this nonsense.

I stumbled upon a purple melon while exploring this remote island. It tasted astringent, and rather lacked taste; my teeth and tongue turned purple from eating the skin and it took a while for the color to fade... Next time I'll try cooking it before eating.
I've set up camp. At first light, I'll walk south... I heard the pirates say that that's where Inazuma is.

There should be plenty of job opportunities in the city. Maybe I should give up the foolish idea of adventuring and find a real job. When I've saved up enough money and bought my own house, I'll send for Dongdong to come live with me.

Besides, the housing here is much cheaper than in Liyue Harbor.
