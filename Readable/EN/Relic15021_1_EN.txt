
Amenoma, Futsu, Isshin, Hyakume, Senju.
These were, once upon a time, the five branches of the Raiden Gokaden,
But today, only Amenoma still maintains its line of succession.
While the Isshin line can just barely be said to have extant descendants.
In the eyes of the people, this is just the natural result of the ravages of time.
They never once suspected that such sudden falls from grace might have some hidden mystery behind them.

The wanderer would never admit to this.
He would never admit that he had done this as an act of revenge against the bladesmith.
Nor would he ever mention the truth,
That he had abandoned his schemes halfway because they had suddenly become dull.
He would only say, in that tone of voice he had learned from a certain researcher:
"It was all just a little experiment into human nature."

In Inazuma's traditional theater, there is a certain character known as "Kunikuzushi."
Such characters are often schemers and usurpers of nations.
At the end of his wanderings, he chose this name as an act of his own will.
And as for the name he had once used, even he no longer remembered it.

It is a norm in Inazuma's traditional theater to join the names of a play's three acts together to form the play's name.
For example, "Sumirezome," "Sangetsu," and "Kogetsukan" come together,
Thus forming the play "Sumirezome Sangetsu Kogetsukan."
Perhaps a day will come when this body's adventures, its experiences,
Will become tales to be passed along by mortals, distant memories that flow through the ley lines.
But for now, his third act is still ongoing.
