He had a very, very long dream...

He dreamed that he and everyone else had gone on a long, long journey,
Into a land where green grass grew, and where soulful songs were sung.
He dreamed that he sang along with the gentle people of this land,
And danced in the skies with a dragon as beauteous as a jewel.

When he opened his eyes, he was in the sky above a mountain swept by roaring snowstorms.
The green, tranquil land had already been painted crimson by fire and blood,
And the song of that sky-blue bard's lyre was almost drowned in the howling tumult.
And that bejeweled, lovely dragon, like a tender lover,
Had now pierced his neck through with its sharp fangs.

"Farewell, Mother! My journey is ended."
"I shall sleep beneath this white, shining silver... and perhaps this, too, is good."
"Farewell, O lovely bard! And farewell, O lovely dragon!"
"Would that we had met in a different time and place,"
"To meet, to sing and dance together!"
So he thought most sincerely as he lay dying.

"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"
"And the lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."
"They are now yours to inherit."
