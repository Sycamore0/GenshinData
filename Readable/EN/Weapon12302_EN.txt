
Legend says that after slaying the venomous dragon,
The famed hero bathed in its blood, for he desired invulnerability.
Sure enough, he became untouchable.
Be it swords, be it spears, or be it rain of arrows,
He laughed and shrugged them off.
Alas, his foes learned,
'Twas with his prized greatsword that he bathed together.
His greatest strength became his fatal weakness.
