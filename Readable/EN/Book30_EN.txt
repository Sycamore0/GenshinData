The Pale Princess ruled her kingdom with kindness and gentleness. She always knew what was best for her people. Under her rule, the people of the Moonlight Forest never knew the threat of the Night Mother's wrath, and the creatures lurking in the dark never dared to set foot in the forest.
However, the Princess had her own troubles. To her, the silvery moon hanging in the night sky seemed like a tiny hole through which the light could pass, and she felt that by following the light back to its source one could almost see the world on the other side. Just like all other people, the Pale Princess would often sit on the stone plate in front of the palace, imagining a world beyond the moonlight.
"Will I be able to bring my people there one day?" The Princess thought to herself. 
"You will."
She had not expected to hear an answer.
The Princess turned and saw a young prince.
