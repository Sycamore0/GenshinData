
Each year, when the Spiritscent Flowers bloom, Qiaoying Village will prepare for its tea-serving ceremonies.
Once the flowers wither, flower tea infused with nine layers of scents are presented in the village hall.
The Spiritscent Flower is a fleeting thing, much like the sudden coming and going of a certain adeptus.
This one left behind the ambiguous name of "Herblord," as well as many foggy and fragmented legends.

In one such tale, the Herblord's adeptal form would turn into the branches of an ancient tea tree.
In another, the adeptus flew up to the adeptal mountain on a subdued evil beast.
There is even a story that goes like this—

The young lady grasped at the hooded hat on the ground as she struggled ashore, placing it on her head haphazardly.
For if she did not cover her face, then she might feel embarrassed and find herself at a loss for words.
Just then, the orchestrator of her suffering poked their head out of the water.
The rainbow-scales on their body glimmered, as if to revel in this victory.

"*cough* Alright! So you can swim! Very impressive! ...You know what? May you drown someday!"

She spoke these words in anger, but also in jest.
And yet that glittering streak would eventually sink into the depths, never to come back to the surface.
