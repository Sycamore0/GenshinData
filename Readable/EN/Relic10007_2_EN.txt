The strict instructor once sharpened his own combat skills on the merciless battlefield.
What he teaches the students goes beyond self-defense techniques to apply in battle.
Moreso than attacking and defending, what he imparts to them is the skill of surviving on the front line even in the face of insurmountable odds.
Every move and technique he demonstrates pays homage to the veterans of wars gone by.
For it was their sacrifices that helped him become who he is today.
