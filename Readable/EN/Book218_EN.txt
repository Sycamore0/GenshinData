—Good Fortune—
A day when nothing especially noteworthy happens — and yet, you cannot help but feel happy.
You will find something you thought was long gone in the nooks and crannies you never noticed before.
Food will taste fresher than usual, and the scenery ahead will appear brighter than ever.
The world is full of new and wonderful things.

Your lucky object for the day: Warm Bird Egg
Eggs brim with limitless potential — they are the seeds of the future.
By the same token, think what the world represents to the life inside the egg:
A place filled with unknown and exciting things.
Just make sure to treat the egg gently.
