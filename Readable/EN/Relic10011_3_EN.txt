One who is favored by fortune can even find priceless treasures in the most deadly of traps.
While wandering around some ruins, the boy known as Lucky Dog accidentally fell into a deep pit.
He landed safely on a pile of dust. It turned out to be a mattress that over the years had gradually broken down, eventually turning to dust.
Just like that, Lucky Dog discovered a treasure trove left by the old aristocrats. This circlet came to epitomize his luck.
