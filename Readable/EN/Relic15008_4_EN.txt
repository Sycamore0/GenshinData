
A common white flower given to the knight by a rescued damsel.
It is dried and hardened by the blood from all his bloodshed.

Thanking him for his valor, the damsel offered a reward.
He turned down all she gave, save for a pure white flower.

"For a knight, chivalry is its own reward."
"This flower shall be my medal. That is all I need."

He wore the flower upon his heart.
Like his armor, it was stained as black as a winter's night.
Like his heart, it was hardened like a tempered blade.
