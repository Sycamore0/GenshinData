Day 7 of the Investigation:

The researchers seem to be planning to use some kind of capturing device to control the aggressive Fungi.
The codename of the device is... a string of complicated terminology. They've also included a license of approval from the Akademiya...
In addition, they're preparing something called the Withering Potion to suppress the Fungi's activity, making them easier to control.
The Withering Potion also came with complex notes and official approval from the Akademiya.
Anyway, I'll record the information down for now.

Day 13 of the Investigation:
...
We failed again. When we returned to the village, two seriously wounded mercenaries insisted on quitting.
Before going to bed, I heard the lead researcher arguing with a few subordinates.
