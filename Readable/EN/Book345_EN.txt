Nikolay's Letter

My dear elder sister Katya,

I heard the Captain say that they were going to transfer you to our regiment. My heart brims with joy at the thought of our reunion!
I've always carried the balalaika you gave me around, doing a bit of repairing here and a bit of mending there. After replacing the frets we'd previously broken, the balalaika sounds much more natural now.
But just for the record, since you asked me to keep it, I'm not gonna give it back to you! If my clumsy sister should damage this old pal of mine once more, I won't go through the trouble of repairing it again!
Oh right, I recently learned two new songs. Wait to be impressed when you report in — let me play the songs to you by the bonfire, just like in the old days when we would sing to the melody of balalaika, giggle at the jokes we share, and look forward to the precious gifts from the Tsaritsa to our brothers and sisters in the House of the Hearth in celebration of a new year...
What's different, however, is that we're no longer carefree children. With greater responsibilities on our shoulders come heavier loads on our minds.

The Captain granted a half-day pass especially for us. Don't forget to bring your liquor and desserts. Let's booze it up and talk it out! I've so many stories to share with you. I believe you too have had quite an adventure where you were previously deployed!
By the way, don't laugh at me if you notice that I've put on some weight! I'll also keep an eye on your "horizontal development"!

I look forward to meeting you.
Nikolay Snezhevich
