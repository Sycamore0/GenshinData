
A common species of flower.
It is curiously capable of resisting the Crimson Witch's flames.

A crisis centuries ago dashed all hope of the maiden seeing the future promised to her.
Those dear to her, her past days, and her bright future. All gone.

From the ashes, the Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and she burned away her pain with fire.
Yet this flower stayed resilient, soft, and moist.
Perhaps both painful and beautiful memories were two sides of the same coin.
