
A bright-red bandana that belonged to a martial artist. The color has now faded.
It serves as proof that the bearer practiced martial arts at a young age. It also represents the high ambition the young martial artist once had.
Before the first crack of dawn, the young martial artist was already training in the forest.
Many years later, the martial artist is now an instructor. Though youth may be a thing of his past, he remains just as alert and diligent as when he was young.
