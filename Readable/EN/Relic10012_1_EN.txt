A delicate tea cup that belonged to a scholar. This treasured cup is made of light porcelain and gilded with gold stripes.
The dainty cup was in stark contrast with the messy room in which it was found, but seemed to suggest that the scholar was from a well-to-do family.
Not caring about the beauty and purpose of the tea cup, the scholar in her ivory tower dipped her quill pen in it.
She only saw it as a convenient ware to wash the tip. Now covered in ink stains, the cup has long since lost its former elegance.
