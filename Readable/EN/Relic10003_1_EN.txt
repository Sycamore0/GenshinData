
An exceedingly ordinary old wine canteen.
If one had to point out something special about it,
It would be that it never once contained a drop of alcohol.

"Come on, you have to try a little wine sometime."
The guardian's longtime friend and superior joked.
"Quit knitting those eyebrows together, have a little wine and song!"
"I mean, that's how we have the courage to face tomorrow."
