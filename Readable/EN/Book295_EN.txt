"I want to save this world!"
Princess Mina said.
"I've told you this many times before. There's no such thing as 'saving this world.' Now, this hasn't stopped idiots like me from trying, of course. But this world... it's doomed."
"I don't care. I'm a princess. Aren't princesses born to save the world?"
"No, I've never heard of any story that goes like that. And last I heard, you were the princess who brings destruction."
"Last I heard, someone said that this 'destruction' is actually the birth of new life."
"Well, I don't where you heard that one, but such beliefs are old hat by now. If you wrote this drivel nowadays, people would chuck it into the nation of Tokoyo, and that would be for the best."
(The Princess covers her ears)

At the top of the Sky Tower, the samurai and princess argued in futility, as if no one was watching.
Well, I say that, but in fact there were quite a few other folk about dressed in the garb of onmyouji.
"So, uh, as you all know, Nakura's Hex was originally created to preserve the vitality of a world that was slowly declining."
As if unable to stand the conversation — and also to push the plot forward in their role as an NPC — the oldest onmyouji finally spoke.
"And that which can utilize this stored vitality..."

"So, could you get these thoughts out of your head?"
The samurai didn't seem to have heard the wizened onmyouji at all.
How long was this farce going to continue?
