Many have never heard her voice, and even those who heard knew not that it was her — and still she heard their wishes. And many have never seen her face, and even those who saw her knew not that it was her — and still she watched over their dreams. For few are those who tell well the tales they hear from afar, and rare are those who teach the truth they have divined with clarity. Even today, her will permeates all, and she dwells in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, watching over the dreams of all who live in this land — just as she did when she returned and commanded the queen of the realm of dreams to break the pure white branches and rebuild the viridescent hunting ground from amidst the withered leaves.

The forest was once overrun by a tide of black beasts, and the endless labyrinth crumbled amidst the flames. The lord of all animals let out a furious roar with its dying breath, then fell protecting all that she had entrusted to him. But her lovely dream could never be snatched away by any woe — for so long as people wait for the next night's dream expectantly, then there shall be new memories, tranquil flowers that bloom betwixt morning dew and moon dust.

This is the promise that she made to the dreamers, the first and final oath. For memories are like pearls — tossed about by wind and sand though they may be, their true, pure color shall never be changed. All beautiful dreams are like the newborn grass — though they may be consumed by sudden flame, the warm spring breeze shall bring them swaying to life again.
