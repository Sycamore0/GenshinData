
A vessel for wine carved from immovable rock.
It is said to be filled with the ambrosia of sovereigns.

It behooves basalt to be impregnable, and crystal to shine in its translucence.
Going incognito amongst mortals should be likewise, exquisite in its enjoyments.

Folk legend holds that in order to drink wine,
Rex Lapis brought forth bedrock,
And carved jade and lovely stone into a wine vessel for himself.

Some even say that there were once seven such vessels.
