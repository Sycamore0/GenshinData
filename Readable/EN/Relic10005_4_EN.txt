In the days before the berserker descended into madness, he would sometimes pause in the rose garden for a moment to himself.
He had never had a family, nor had he a lover, or a friend.
When he was not on the battlefield, he would come here to tend to the fragile flowers in the garden with all his heart,
as if the crimson flowers buried in the thorns were the only warmth he could cling to.
