You who come after us:
If there was a prayer in praise of the night, then I would sing its first strain in memory of the lost.
For Umur, who lost his way.
"Before the searing sands melted your bones, the flaming golden light scorched your ambitions. It covered all our eyes, and it will cover you, perhaps even before it shall see you erased."
Before we set out, I stated that this was a journey accursed, but no one would listen.
I know who it is I must believe. The nourisher of my spirit, the servant of the Goddess of Flowers — she knows that which is true.
Now, we have lost Umur. As we approached the ruins of Gurabad, he was separated from us by a cyclone. His body was buried beneath the rolling sands, and his spirit now swirls in the wind for ever. He shall never know peace.
Perhaps we should advance no further.
