Dear Anton Melnikov,

I'm sorry that due to the sudden turn of events, the supply station has been shut down. Our previous plan to drink Fire-Water together upon your return seems impossible now.
I left some food here in secret. It should be enough in the short run. Take as much as you need.
Sorry, as your friend, I can't do much more than this. The next time we meet, we shall be enemies. Although I am aware that you and your mission have nothing to do with what happened on the ground, please understand that we can never forgive such a blatant act of invasion.
Just as you fight for the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya, as one of the Millelith, I must protect our homeland. We each have our responsibilities to shoulder for what we cherish.

Best of luck to you. Yours sincerely, Yanbo.
