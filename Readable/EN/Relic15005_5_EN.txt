A luxurious hourglass belonging to the ancient tribe that worshiped the Thunderbird.
As the tribe faded away, so did the hourglass.

A luxurious hourglass, made with amethyst and amber gold, that belonged to a shaman.
The hourglass would serve its purpose for the festival held in the Thunderbird's honor.

In the last festival the tribe held, the frenzied Thunderbird blew away the bloodstained altar.
The countdown to the arrival of the protector became the countdown to the tribe's destruction.
The Thunderbird decimated the tribe to avenge the one who sang to it.

Unbeknownst to the Thunderbird, the lad himself considered his sacrifice as an offering.
All for the good of the tribe, for the blessings of the Thunderbird.
