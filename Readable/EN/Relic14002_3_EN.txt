
A very ancient diadem.
It shines with the light of the pacified lightning.

The ferocious Beast of Thunder
once enslaved people with its mighty lightning.
But its lightning existed only in a flash,
and like the lightning, its mightiness soon disappeared.

The Thundersoother defeated the beast in a lightning storm.
He claimed this diadem as his trophy.
But the past can never be fully pacified.
