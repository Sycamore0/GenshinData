A manual on magic that is popular amongst students, it is portable enough to fit into one's pocket.
It has been stripped of the lengthy descriptions of principles and voluminous exercises. All that is left now is exam content.
Currently obsolete due to the revisions made in the 12th edition of the Magic Guide.
