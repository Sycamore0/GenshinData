—Modest Fortune—
Clouds cover half the moon and the fog is thick.
Above you is the moon shrouded by cloud. Ahead of you, everything is engulfed by fog.
Though the way ahead seems unclear at the moment, all will become clear when the time comes.
Take this opportunity to improve yourself while waiting for the clouds to clear.

Your lucky object for the day: Luminescent Spine
The Luminescent Spine shines with a faint glow, but shines strong nonetheless.
Though it may not be the brightest of lights, it is enough to illuminate the road ahead.
