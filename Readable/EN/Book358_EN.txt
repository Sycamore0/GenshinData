The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito

Long have I been famed, and since my youth I had great ambition.
I stamped every new verse with a scarlet seal, and thus was I known to all.
But last year when we presented our verses, mine was found to be taken from poets past.
For the theft and deception, I was banished into the wilderness.
The five radiant lights never shall be again — ah, how the tides do shift!
