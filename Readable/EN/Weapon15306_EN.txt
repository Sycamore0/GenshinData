Both strength and skill are required to use a longbow.
This ebony longbow requires a greater force, as it is sturdier.
Yet some say ebony meant not the material of the bow.
In the past, one hunter hunted dangerous prey with his wooden longbow.
He hunted until his fingers slit, dying the bow black. A black bloodlust then filled his heart.
The stains on the bow could be washed clean, but the same was not true for his heart.
