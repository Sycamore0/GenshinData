The phrase "time and wind" seems like it may have something to do with the Anemo Archon... But couldn't he have been clearer? What am I supposed to figure out with just these three words?

If it has something to do with the Anemo Archon, then whatever clues may be found should also be related to Anemo.

Then if one factors in the idea of "time"... This sundial over here should hide some secret.

Moreover, I do get an odd feeling around this place sometimes. I think it might have been 2 AM... Or was it some other time...?

I really can't remember... I only remember that sometime <color=#00E1FFFF>before dawn</color>, the <color=#00E1FFFF>shadow cast by the sundial's pointer points right below it</color>.

But... Well, fine. The lecturers at the Akademiya used to say that it would be best for people without <color=#00E1FFFF>Visions</color> not to take part in practicum such as outdoor surveys.

I didn't understand what they meant then, but I suppose I do now. Even though I did find a clue, all I could do without a <color=#00E1FFFF>Vision</color> was watch.

I wonder if the Adventurers' Guild can help me find someone who has a <color=#00E1FFFF>Vision</color> and is willing to help.

Speaking of which, why is Mondstadt's Adventurers' Guild still so tiny?
