Dear Traveler,
Would that I could convey this message to you in person.
I apologize for the hasty means by which this letter has come to you, and I hope that it hasn't left you feeling perplexed or perturbed in any way.
This is my first time extending an invitation to an unknown outlander, after all.
It is no mere coincidence that our paths have crossed.
Therefore,
I hope that you would be so courteous as to meet me tonight, under the glow of resplendent moonlight.

Please do not fret about retainers and bodyguards, I will ensure that their attention shall be elsewhere.
I look forward to the pleasure of your company.
