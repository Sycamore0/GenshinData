"And sweet memories must fade like a cloud."
In the beginning, the banquet belonged to the mistress of flowers and moonlit nights, authority was in the hands of the desert king, and life was the domain of the keeper of plants.

"In those days, the moonlight would tell of their happiness to the nightingale and the rose."
"And they were so frightened and abashed that they could sing no song in response."
"Peace and ease reigned, and there was no division or misfortune in this worriless paradise..."
"If only these wonderful days, as lovely as a shimmering mirage, could last for eternity, and that they should never have to taste the bitterness of parting."

"Meld all thoughts into one, and let all calculations be unified."
"Thus shall humanity become the lord of lords and the god of gods."
So went the dirge for that most lonesome king of kings,
For whom the gilded sands had long divined failure.
