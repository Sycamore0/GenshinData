(This obelisk was buried deep underground, and so its inscription is very well-preserved.)
Praise Badanah our king, for before him even the myriad schemes of Muzzudin appear to be but folly!
His virtues are above the other rulers, and besides food and drink he desires nothing.
His bloodline is noble and pure, and his father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord.
His mighty hand stretches out and subdues the sands, and the claws of his hunting eagles are like swords and spears.
His brothers are befuddled and feeble, and so shall the ninety-nine kingdoms fall under one ruler once more.
Come then, raise your glasses!
Let the refreshing wine reflect our king's glorious visage, and let the balms from afar send forth their fragrance.
Even should the sandstorms invade the oases, and the trees wither forever,
Our king shall rule forever, golden crown'd, and to the ends of the earth shall his great name ring.
