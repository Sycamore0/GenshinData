(This inscription has been made with very deep cuts, as if made using very rudimentary tools. The author seems to have had a very good education, but the awkwardness apparent throughout the writing tells of this person's difficult living conditions.)

None now know how much time has passed since Gurabad's great Spirit of Victory was slain, and now naught but blood and tears weave the lines of kings.
